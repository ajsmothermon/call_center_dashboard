## Call Center Dashboard

This dashboard is an example of a call center's performance. Below outlines the context for why a dashboard was needed, the user stories mapped to the KPIs, and the process for arriving at the dashboard. 

**PLEASE NOTE:** ALL DATA IN THIS DASHBOARD IS FAKE AND WAS CREATED BY THE AUTHOR (ANDREW SMOTHERMON). THIS IN NO WAY DESCRIBES, OR RELATES TO, ANY PAST OR CURRENT CLIENT INFORMATION

### Background

McGyver Inc. is a business-to-business hardware manufacturing company that sells widgets across the state of Nebraska. The organization is divided into 4 regions (North, South, East, West), and each region has two divisions. These divisions are resposible for two things:

* Selling widgets to company's across their territory in Nebraska
* Providing customer service when there is an issue with a widget via their **call center**

Sales have been great at McGyver Inc., however, some **complaints about customer service call center** have reached the C-Suite. Leadership realized that while they collect data on their customer service, they have not built out any reporting to understand **what could be driving poor customer service outcomes**.

Call center data is basic but **they do catalog every customer service call and ask customers to rate their service on a 1-5 likert scale**.

### User Stories and KPIs

After consultation with Fox-Smothermon Consulting LLC., McGyver Inc. leadership has tailored a **Problem Statement** along with user stories and KPIs that could help them better understand call center operations and what is driving poor customer service. 

#### Problem Statement

McGyver Inc. leadership currently has no insight into call center operations. Reporting is required to better understand what regions/divisions are receiving poor customer service survey ratings
